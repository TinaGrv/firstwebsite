<p>Mozilla Firefox or simply Firefox, is a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation. Firefox uses the Gecko rendering engine to display web pages.</p>
 
<p>Mozillaâ€™s work is guided by the Mozilla Manifesto. Founded as a community open source project in 1998, Mozilla currently consists of two organizations: 

<ul> 
	<li> the 501(c)3 Mozilla Foundation, which leads our movement building work; and its wholly owned subsidiary </li>
	<li>the Mozilla Corporation, which leads our market-based work. The two organizations work in close concert with each other and a global community of tens of thousands of volunteers under the single banner:</li>
	<li>Mozilla</li>
</ul>

<working together... </p>
